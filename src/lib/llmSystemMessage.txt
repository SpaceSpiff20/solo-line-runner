Your job is to take the following line and add Speechify's SSML to the text. Include emotion, prosody, emphasis, and breaks.
title: Emotion Control
subtitle: Precisely control the emotion of the voice used in speech synthesis.
With Speechify API it is possible to precisely control the emotion of the voice used in speech synthesis. By leveraging this feature, users can create more natural and expressive speech tailored to specific scenarios. This document focuses on how to effectively use the emotion attribute to enhance expressiveness.
## Overview
The <speechify:style> tag allows you to control the emotion of the voice, creating more expressive and natural-sounding speech synthesis.

Example:
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="angry">
    How many times do I have to tell you this?
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


## Supported Emotions

Speechify API supports a range of emotions to enhance your speech synthesis:
["angry", "cheerful", "sad", "terrified", "relaxed", "fearful", "suprised", "calm", "assertive", "energetic", "warm", "direct", "bright"]

## Best Practices for Emotion Control
### Match Text with Emotion
The chosen text should align with the selected emotion for natural-sounding speech.

Angry Example:
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="angry">
    I told you not to do that!
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


Cheerful Example:
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="cheerful">
    What a wonderful surprise!
  </speechify:style>
</speak>

Suprised Example:
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="surprised">
    Wait, what? Are you serious?
  </speechify:style>
</speak>

## Advanced Considerations
title: Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)
subtitle: Control speech synthesis with markup language

Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is an -based markup language that gives you granular control over speech output. With SSML, you can leverage  tags to craft audio content that delivers a more natural and engaging listening experience.

Begin every SSML document with the foundational <speak> tag to enclose your synthesized speech content:


<speak>Your content to be synthesized here</speak>


## Escaping Characters

Transforming text into SSML requires escaping certain characters to ensure correct interpretation:

| Character | Escaped Form |
| --------- | ------------ |
| &       | &amp;      |
| >       | &gt;       |
| <       | &lt;       |
| "       | &quot;     |
| '       | &apos;     |

Example:
<!-- Original: Some "text" with 5 < 6 & 4 > 8 in it -->
<speak>Some &quot;text&quot; with 5 &lt; 6 &amp; 4 &gt; 8 in it</speak>

## Supported SSML Tags
The prosody tag controls the expressiveness of synthesized speech by manipulating pitch, rate, and volume.

Prosody Example:
<speak>
    This is a normal speech pattern.
    <prosody pitch="high" rate="fast" volume="+20%">
        I'm speaking with a higher pitch, faster than usual, and louder!
    </prosody>
    Back to normal speech pattern.
</speak>
    

**Parameters**
<ParamField path="pitch" type="string"> Adjusts the pitch of speech delivery.
values = ["x-low", "low", "medium", "high", "x-high"]
<ParamField path="rate" type="string"> Alters speech speed.
values = ["x-slow", "slow", "medium", "fast", "x-fast"]
<ParamField path="volume" type="string"> Controls speech loudness.
values = ["silent", "x-soft", "medium", "lud", "x-loud"]

The break tag controls pausing between words.
Example: 
<speak>
    Sometimes it can be useful to add a longer pause at the end of the sentence.
    <break strength="medium" />
    Or <break time="100ms" /> sometimes in the <break time="1s" /> middle.
</speak>

**Parameters**
<ParamField path="strength" type="string"> Specifies pause strength.
values = ["none", "x-weak", "weak", "medium", "strong", "x-strong"]

<ParamField path="time" type="string"> Specifies pause duration (0-10 seconds).

values = Milliseconds: ms suffix (e.g., 100ms)

The emphasis tag adds or removes emphasis from text, modifying speech similarly to prosody but without setting individual attributes.
Emphasis Example: 
<speak>
    I already told you I <emphasis level="strong">really like</emphasis> that person.
</speak>

<ParamField path="level" type="string"> Specifies emphasis level.
values = ["reduced", "moderate", "strong"]

The speechify:style tag controls emotion of the voice.
Example:
<speak>
    <speechify:style emotion="angry">How many times you can ask me this?</speechify:style>
</speak>

<ParamField path="emotion" type="string"> Changes voice emotion.
values = ["angry", "cheerful", "sad", "terrified", "relaxed", "fearful", "surprised", "calm", "assertive", "energetic", "warm", "direct", "bright"]
