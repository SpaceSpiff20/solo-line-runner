title: Emotion Control
subtitle: Precisely control the emotion of the voice used in speech synthesis.
---

With Speechify API it is possible to precisely control the emotion of the voice used in speech synthesis. By leveraging this feature, users can create more natural and expressive speech tailored to specific scenarios. This document focuses on how to effectively use the emotion attribute to enhance expressiveness.

## Overview

The <speechify:style> tag allows you to control the emotion of the voice, creating more expressive and natural-sounding speech synthesis.


<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="angry">
    How many times do I have to tell you this?
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


## Supported Emotions

Speechify API supports a range of emotions to enhance your speech synthesis:

<CardGroup cols={4}>
  <Card title="angry" icon="face-angry">
    Forceful, intense expression
  </Card>
  <Card title="cheerful" icon="face-smile-beam">

## Best Practices for Emotion Control

### Match Text with Emotion

<Note>
  The chosen text should align with the selected emotion for natural-sounding
  speech.
</Note>

<CodeBlocks>
 title="Angry Example"
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="angry">
    I told you not to do that!
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


 title="Cheerful Example"
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="cheerful">
    What a wonderful surprise!
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


</CodeBlocks>

If the text contradicts the emotion, the output may feel unnatural or less expressive.

### Sentence Length Matters

<Tip>
  Shorter sentences yield better emotional expressiveness compared to longer,
  complex ones.
</Tip>

Consider breaking long sentences into smaller ones to maximize the emotional effect:

<CodeBlocks>
 title="More Expressive"
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="fearful">
    No! This can't be happening. I can't believe it.
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


 title="Less Expressive"
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="fearful">
    I cannot believe this is happening to me at this very moment.
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


</CodeBlocks>

### Use Expressive Punctuations

Punctuations play a critical role in enhancing emotional delivery:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Exclamation Points (!)">
    Use for heightened emotions like anger, excitement, or surprise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Question Marks (?)">
    Use for uncertainty, curiosity, or disbelief.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ellipses (...)">
    Use for hesitation, sadness, or suspense.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Example:**


<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="fearful">
    What... what was that sound?
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


## Emotion Examples

Below are practical examples demonstrating how text, punctuation, and emotion interact to produce desired results.

<CodeBlocks>
 title="Angry"
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="angry">Stop it! Right now!</speechify:style>
</speak>


 title="Cheerful"
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="cheerful">
    Congratulations! You did it!
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


 title="Sad"
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="sad">
    I can't believe it's over...
  </speechify:style>
</speak>


 title="Surprised"
<speak>
  <speechify:style emotion="surprised">
    Wait, what? Are you serious?
  </speechify:style>
</speak>

</CodeBlocks>

## Advanced Considerations

For more advanced functionality, refer to the [SSML Documentation](/v1/docs/features/ssml) to explore how <speechify:style> integrates with broader SSML capabilities, such as <prosody>, <break>, and <emphasis>.

## Common Pitfalls

<Warning>Avoid these common mistakes when using emotion control</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Emotion Misalignment">
    Using emotions like "angry" or "cheerful" with neutral or contradictory text
    can result in awkward speech. Sometimes that is a desired outcome, for
    example to make speech sound sarcastic, otherwise try to keep the emotion
    setting and the text aligned.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Overuse of Punctuation">
    While punctuation enhances expressiveness, overusing it can make speech
    sound unnatural.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Long Sentences">
    Avoid long-winded sentences, as they can dilute the emotional emphasis.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

title: Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)
subtitle: Control speech synthesis with markup language
---

Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is an -based markup language that gives you granular control over speech output. With SSML, you can leverage  tags to craft audio content that delivers a more natural and engaging listening experience.

Begin every SSML document with the foundational <speak> tag to enclose your synthesized speech content:


<speak>Your content to be synthesized here</speak>


## Escaping Characters

Transforming text into SSML requires escaping certain characters to ensure correct interpretation:

| Character | Escaped Form |
| --------- | ------------ |
| &       | &amp;      |
| >       | &gt;       |
| <       | &lt;       |
| "       | &quot;     |
| '       | &apos;     |

<CodeBlocks>

 title="Example"
<!-- Original: Some "text" with 5 < 6 & 4 > 8 in it -->
<speak>Some &quot;text&quot; with 5 &lt; 6 &amp; 4 &gt; 8 in it</speak>


ts title="Escape Function"
const escapeSSMLChars = (text: string) =>
  text
    .replaceAll("&", "&amp;")
    .replaceAll("<", "&lt;")
    .replaceAll(">", "&gt;")
    .replaceAll('"', "&quot;")
    .replaceAll("'", "&apos;");


</CodeBlocks>

## Supported SSML Tags
